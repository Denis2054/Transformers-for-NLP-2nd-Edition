Amoebas are single-celled organisms that move by extending part of their body forward, and then flowing into the space it created. So, by saying \"I don't use a false foot to move forward,\" the speaker is implying that they don't pretend to be something they are not, and they don't manipulate their surroundings in a clever way to get ahead.
