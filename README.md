**Under the hood working of transformers, fine-tuning GPT-3 models, DeBERTa, vision models, and the start of Metaverse, using a variety of NLP platforms: Hugging Face, OpenAI API, Trax, and AllenNLP**

##Key Features
Implement models, such as BERT, Reformer, and T5, that outperform classical language models<br>
Compare NLP applications using GPT-3, GPT-2, and other transformers<br>
Analyze advanced use cases, including polysemy, cross-lingual learning, and computer vision<br>
## Book Description
Transformers are a game-changer for natural language understanding (NLU) and have become one of the pillars of artificial intelligence.<br>

Transformers for Natural Language Processing, 2nd Edition, investigates deep learning for machine translations, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, language modeling, question-answering, and many more NLP domains with transformers.<br>

An Industry 4.0 AI specialist needs to be adaptable; knowing just one NLP platform is not enough anymore. Different platforms have different benefits depending on the application, whether it's cost, flexibility, ease of implementation, results, or performance. In this book, we analyze numerous use cases with Hugging Face, Google Trax, OpenAI, and AllenNLP.<br>

This book takes transformers' capabilities further by combining multiple NLP techniques, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and semantic role labeling, to analyze complex use cases, such as dissecting fake news on Twitter. Also, see how transformers can create code using just a brief description.<br>

By the end of this NLP book, you will understand transformers from a cognitive science perspective and be proficient in applying pretrained transformer models to various datasets.<br>

## What you will learn
Discover new ways of performing NLP techniques with the latest pretrained transformers<br>
Grasp the workings of the original Transformer, GPT-3, BERT, T5, DeBERTa, and Reformer<br>
Create language understanding Python programs using concepts that outperform classical deep learning models<br>
Apply Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch programs to sentiment analysis, text summarization, speech recognition, machine translations, and more<br>
Measure the productivity of key transformers to define their scope, potential, and limits in production<br>
## Who This Book Is For
If you want to learn about and apply transformers to your natural language (and image) data, this book is for you.<br>

A good understanding of NLP, Python, and deep learning is required to benefit most from this book. Many platforms covered in this book provide interactive user interfaces, which allow readers with a general interest in NLP and AI to follow several chapters of this book.<br>
